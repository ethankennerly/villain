Dave Alleca showed me Spike: A Love Story.

It has a simple reaction task:  Watch the mobile object and anticipate when to press Space bar.
It evolves upon that.
What is the fun? 
Smash, squash, splash blood, laugh and try not be outwitted.
It's really sadistic.  Yet the mechanism is simple and the evolution of the challenge interests me.

    Sleeping Dragon
    Dragon's Gold
    Sleeping Dragon, Stealing Treasure
    Dragon Cave
    Dragon's Mouth

Why cannot dragon breathe fire nearby and only at a distance?
If dragon does, then that becomes the dominant strategy, 
unless fire charge up time prevents bite and charge up time is very slow.
Bite once before and after gold.
Will it look like a dragon?
Walk in front of dragon.
When dragon opens its mouth it will bite.

Peasant:  Walks toward gold, drags it back.  Tactic:  Bite or breathe fire.
Peasant and Peasant.  Tactic:  bite twice or breathe fire.
Knight:  Walks toward gold, drags it back.  Armor absorbs 1 hit (after Ghouls n Ghosts).  Tactic:  Bite twice.
Thief:  Hide in shadow.  Take gold and go back.  Run.  Tactic:  Time fire, or time bite.
Thief and Peasant.  Tactic:  Time bite.
Knight and Thief.  Tactic:  Time bite three times.
Wizard:  Teleports gold from a distance.  Tactic:  Breathe fire.
Wizard and Knight.  Tactic:  Breathe fire, bite.
Priest:  Does not take gold.  Tactic:  Breathe fire.
Priest and Knight:  Does not take gold.  Force field knight.  Tactic:  Breathe fire.
Wizard and Thief.  Tactic:  Breathe fire, time bite.
Thief:  Jump fire.
Priest.  Heals knight from behind.  

Dragon looks like it is sleeping.
Cute dragon.  Cute 8 bit characters, squat.
Gold slows down character.

Dragon a slope, so gold rolls back to cave.
Or gold simply stays where it is and may be easily picked up.
In between, dragon's tail wipes gold back in place.  If no one on screen, press space to move gold back.
Breathing fire reels back and lunges forward, so misses short range.

Lose all gold.  Lose.
Kill all heroes.  Win.
Count waves survived.  


Ghost n goblins
Link:  Fast.
Mario:  Jumps fire.

could be:
    Sounds on movie clip labels also.
    All objects loaded from scene movieclip.
    FlxClip adds animations.


Sat Dec 15 09:54:23 PST 2012

max level
all clips in scene.
if all clips in scene then may be difficult to distinguish which peasant is which.  
Could add them all to the same group.
Would also get very wide to see when waves will occur.
    Limit velocity when off screen.
    May be difficult to detect when wave is finished.
    Could establish it as an amount of time.
Could spawn each when desired.  
Parse scene.  Read position.  
Add each to a Flixel group.
